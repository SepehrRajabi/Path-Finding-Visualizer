# 🔍 Pathfinding Visualizer

A visual, interactive pathfinding tool built with **Pygame**. Watch the chosen algorithm find the shortest path in real-time, powered by multithreading to keep the UI responsive.

## ✨ Features

- **A\* Algorithm** — Finds the shortest path with real-time animation
- **Interactive Grid** — Place start, end, and walls with your mouse
- **Multithreaded** — Algorithm runs on a separate thread, keeping the UI responsive

### TODO

- [x] Support multiple algorithms (Dijkstra, BFS)
- [x] Support multiple heuristics (Manhattan, Euclidean, Chebyshev)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Pygame
